️ Weather App
FLUTTER DEVELOPER TASK
In continuation of our interview process and to assess your learning ability and Flutter
development skills, we have designed a task that requires you to learn and apply the BLoC
pattern while solving a real-world problem.

🔍 The Challenge:
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, create a Flutter application that fulfills the following
requirements:
● Allow users to search for a city's weather using the city name
● Show:
○ City Name
○ Temperature (in Celsius)
○ Weather Condition (e.g. Rain, Clear)
○ Optional: Humidity, Wind Speed
● Display a loading indicator while fetching data
● Handle API errors gracefully (invalid city name, network issue)
🎯 Must Haves:
● A state management solution: **BLoC pattern using **flutter_bloc package
● Dio for API calls
● Proper error handling for API failures and invalid responses
● Clean and maintainable folder structure:
○ Separate Blocs, Events, States
○ Use Models and Repository pattern

✅ Good to Have:
● Basic animations and transitions
● Theming: light/dark mode toggle

● Global theming with ThemeData
● Responsive UI design
● Unit test or widget test (especially for BLoC)
● Code comments & documentation
🍫 Extra Brownie Points:
● Pull to refresh functionality
● Save weather data locally (cache last searched result)
● Show weather in both Celsius & Fahrenheit (toggle switch)
● Store search history and allow users to repeat a past search
